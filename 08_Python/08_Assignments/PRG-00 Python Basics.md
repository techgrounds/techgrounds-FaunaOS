1. **Syntax**: Python has a clean and readable syntax that emphasizes code readability. It uses indentation (whitespace) to define code blocks, unlike other languages that use curly braces. For example:
   
   ```python
   if x > 5:
       print("x is greater than 5")
   else:
       print("x is not greater than 5")
   ```

2. **Variables and Data Types**: Variables are used to store data. Python supports various data types such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Declare variables like this:

   ```python
   age = 25
   name = "John"
   salary = 1500.50
   ```

3. **Operators**: Python supports a wide range of operators for mathematical and logical operations, like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `and`, `or`, etc.

4. **Control Structures**:
   - **Conditionals**: Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for decision-making based on conditions.
   - **Loops**: Python provides `for` loops and `while` loops for iterating through sequences or performing actions repeatedly.

5. **Functions**: Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks. They help keep your code organized and modular. You can define a function like this:

   ```python
   def greet(name):
       print("Hello, " + name)
   ```

6. **Lists and Iteration**: Lists are collections of items. You can iterate through them using loops. For example:

   ```python
   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
   for fruit in fruits:
       print(fruit)
   ```

7. **Strings**: Strings are sequences of characters. Python provides various string manipulation methods like slicing, concatenation, and formatting.

   ```python
   message = "Hello, World!"
   print(message[0])  # Prints 'H'
   print(message[7:])  # Prints 'World!'
   ```

8. **Input and Output**: You can interact with users using the `input()` function and display output using `print()`. For example:

   ```python
   name = input("Enter your name: ")
   print("Hello, " + name)
   ```

9. **Error Handling**: Python allows you to handle exceptions using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. This helps you gracefully manage unexpected errors.

   ```python
   try:
       result = 10 / 0
   except ZeroDivisionError:
       print("Error: Cannot divide by zero")
   ```

10. **Modules and Libraries**: Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and modules that provide additional functionality. You can import and use them in your code. For instance, the `math` module provides mathematical functions.

    ```python
    import math
    print(math.sqrt(25))  # Prints the square root of 25
    ```
