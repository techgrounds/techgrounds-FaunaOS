#Create a new script.
#Create a variable x and give it the value 0.
x = 0

print(x)
#Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop. After printing, the value of x should increase by 1. The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.

#here we define the while function and use < to let the function know till when to run in this case 11
while x < 11:
  print(x)
  x = x + 1
